# 🤖 Simple Python ChatBot (Console-Based)

This is a basic **rule-based chatbot** built in Python. It responds to a few predefined inputs such as greetings and common phrases. A great beginner project to understand how basic conditionals and loops work in Python.

## ✅ Features

- Responds to basic inputs:
  - `hello` → "Hi!"
  - `how are you` → "I'm fine, thanks!"
  - `bye` → exits the chatbot
- All other inputs receive a default fallback response
- Case-insensitive input handling
- Console-based user interface

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard input/output functions
- Conditional logic with `if-elif-else`
- Infinite loop with `while True`
